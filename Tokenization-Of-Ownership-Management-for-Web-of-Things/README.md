# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```


### INFORMATION

> npm and node version for this project

npm version : 8.5.0
node version : v16.14.2

### SOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEMS

Do not install Hardhat globally. If you already have installed hardhat globally, please uninstall as the issue might be because of that as mentioned in the error message.

Things you need to do to mitigate this:

Check if the project package.json has hardhat as its dev dependency. If it is not, run 
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat or yarn add --dev hardhat
```

Uninstall any global version of hardhat

Remove ***node_modules*** and run ***npm install*** or ***yarn install*** to install all dependencies.
Try running npx hardhat compile or npx hardhat node to check if it works.

You need to run specific solutions for dependency tree in node virtual machine

```bash
npm config set legacy-peer-deps true
``` 



## INTERACTION WITH HARDHAT SUITE

First, you need to run 'npx hardhat node'

And then, you can type the following command: 

```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts
```

So you need to connect hardhat console

```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

Try the following commands (For Testing Purpose): 

```bash
const resourcecontract = await ethers.getContractFactory("Resource")
const resource = await resourcecontract.attach("0xf5059a5D33d5853360D16C683c16e67980206f36")
await resource.getName()
```

Result is: 

> Resource Deploy.ts

```bash
const Admin = await ethers.getContractFactory("Administrator");
const admin = await Admin.attach('0x851356ae760d987e095750cceb3bc6014560891c'); //contract address of Administrator
const result = await admin.createAdministrativeRoles();
console.log(result);
//resultOfCall = await medPattern.connect(owner).createAdministrativeRoles();
```

We have a hash code from the blockchain block.

Result is: 

```bash
{
  hash: '0xa3afc4b5fa3c265284cff0bff668192732b0d0f90530074627a10c9029b833ba',

About your question: Why cannot we access events in hardhat console.

Reason: The event logs are not accessible from within smart contracts. Basically, you are interacting 
smart contracts in the blockchain, not with an external client.

When you test smart contracts with your test cases, you are an external client and you can catch events. You can put console.log with "hardhat/console.sol" library because the application itself behaves as an external client within smart contracts through hardhat framework.


## INTEGRATION WITH Web Of Things (Eclipse web of things)

Please install the following package through npm command: 

```bash
npm install @node-wot/core
npm i @node-wot/binding-http
```

Run the server application with the following command

```bash
npx ts-node test/WebOfThingsServer.ts
```

### Some Tests

You can test hardhat-ethers that brings the Ethereum library (ethers.js) to Hardhat software development suite with the Ethereum blockchain in a simple way.

# Interaction with Smart Contracts

Interaction with the hardhat development suite

Open the blockchain network with the following command: 

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
```

Connect to the hardhat console at localhost: 

```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```
